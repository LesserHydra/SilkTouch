# SilkTouch

## Info

SilkTouch is a Bukkit plugin which allows players to silktouch and place spawners and silverfish blocks.

_Note that this should never be enabled on a creative server_, as it creates a vulnerability which essentially OPs creative players. It's an issue inherent to allowing players to place spawners.
